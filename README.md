### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub. I just created a README.md in my personal repository PeterCullenBurbery.

I really like JetBrains IDEs. I have access to JetBrains products for free as a student. I have used IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm, Fleet, WebStorm, Datagrip, Space, MPS, Android Studio, and Php Storm. I use GitHub to sync work for my classes at Marshall University between computers and for work I do with Wolfram Mathematica which I also use a lot.

I also enjoy using BricsCAD Ultimate by Bricscys which I have access to for free as a student. I am also excited about GitHub copilot which I have access to for free as a student. I am excited about AI. I am excited about ChatGPT and other applications of AI including Muzero and AlphaFold.

I love New York City and other megacities and believe the future is in cities.

I also enjoy the site whimsical.com a lot, which I highly recommend.

I have a website at peterburbery.com. I have a page that serves as a repository for information about the SI at https://peterburbery.com/the-international-system-of-units-si/

I'm working on a minor in computer science at Marshall University and I have also learned at Zero to Mastery Academy and freecodecamp.org. I also enjoy reading the art of computer programming by Donald Knuth.

I'm currently learning about combinatorics, factorials, binomials, subfactorials, Catalan numbers, multinomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, permutations, combinations, and derangements. 

I enjoy learning about American Civil War history and the great general Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. I also enjoy the writings of C. S. Lewis, St. Augustine, George MacDonald, and G. K. Chesterton.

I enjoy learning physics with materials by Richard Feynman with the Feymann lectures, Stephen Wolfram, and Douglas C. Giancoli.

I like Wikipedia, which I edit a lot. I also like freecodecamp.org founded by Quincy Larson. I also like lichess.org where I sometimes play chess.
