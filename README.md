### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub. I just created a README.md in my personal repository PeterCullenBurbery.
I realize I have a lot of GitHub repositories.

I have brought my repository basic hypergeometric functions up to GitHub Community Standards.

I am working as an intern with the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) with Howard Cohl, who has two PhDs. I am working on formatting basic hypergeometric functions in LaTeX. I am majoring in Computer science at Marshall University and am considering getting either an accelerated Masters's Degree in Computer Science at Marshall or a PhD in Computer Science which Marshall does not offer in Computer Science.

I have experience with Alma Linux, Cent OS linux, Rocky Linux, Linux Mint, Fedora Linux, Kali linux, Pop linux, Ubuntu Linux, Manjaro Linux, and Arch Linux.

I am looking forward to ITER achieving Q=10 in 2035 in France. I believe sustained thermonuclear fusion controlled in a tokamak is the best way to ensure a good future of clean energy for future generations.

I like JetBrains IDEs. I have access to JetBrains products for free as a student. I have used IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm, Fleet, WebStorm, Datagrip, Space, MPS, Android Studio, and Php Storm. I use GitHub to sync work for my classes at Marshall University between computers and for work I do with Wolfram Mathematica which I also use a lot. I like using Chocolately to install packages on Windows.

I also enjoy using BricsCAD Ultimate by Bricscys which I have access to for free as a student. I am also excited about GitHub copilot which I have access to for free as a student. I am excited about AI. I am excited about ChatGPT and other applications of AI including Muzero and AlphaFold.

I love New York City.

I have also learned at Zero to Mastery Academy and freecodecamp.org. I also enjoy reading the art of computer programming by Donald Knuth.

I'm currently learning about combinatorics, factorials, binomials, subfactorials, Catalan numbers, multinomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, permutations, combinations, and derangements. 

I enjoy learning about American Civil War history and the great general Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. I also enjoy the writings of C. S. Lewis, St. Augustine, George MacDonald, and G. K. Chesterton.

I enjoy learning physics with materials by Richard Feynman with the Feymann lectures, Stephen Wolfram, and Douglas C. Giancoli.

I like Wikipedia, which I edit a lot. I also like freecodecamp.org founded by Quincy Larson. I also like lichess.org where I sometimes play chess.

I like Star Wars the first six movies. I don't think the new movies are canonical.

I have completed freecodecamp.org's responsive web design curriculum at https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/petercullenburbery/responsive-web-design.

I have a website at peterburbery.com. I have a page that serves as a repository for information about the SI at https://peterburbery.com/the-international-system-of-units-si/

**PeterCullenBurbery/PeterCullenBurbery** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dimensional analysis with Mathematica.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing the app GPSTest.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mixed chinese postman problem
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about arc routing and graph theory and chinese postman problem
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: petercullenburbery@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he him his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think Mathematica is the best programming language.
