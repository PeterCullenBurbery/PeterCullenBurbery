### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub. I just create a README.md in my personal repository PeterCullenBurbery.

I'm currently learning about combinatorics, factorials, binomials, subfactorials, Catalan numbers, multinomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, permutations, combinations, and derangements.

<!--
**PeterCullenBurbery/PeterCullenBurbery** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dimensional analysis with Mathematica.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing the app GPSTest.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mixed chinese postman problem
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about arc routing and graph theory and chinese postman problem
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: petercullenburbery@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he him his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think Mathematica is the best programming language.
