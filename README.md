### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub. I just created a README.md in my personal repository PeterCullenBurbery.
I realize I have a lot of GitHub repositories.
I have a blog post at https://peterburbery.com/2024/03/13/create-a-database-with-postgresql-and-valentina-studio/.

I am not storing any pdf files that would be guilty of copyright infringement on GitHub. To be sure, I searched user:PeterCullenBurbery path:*.pdf on GitHub and I got 0 results.

I have brought my repository's basic hypergeometric functions up to GitHub Community Standards.

I am working as an intern with the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) with Howard Cohl, who has two PhDs. I am working on formatting basic hypergeometric functions in LaTeX. I am majoring in Computer science at Marshall University and am considering getting either an accelerated Masters's Degree in Computer Science at Marshall or a PhD in Computer Science which Marshall does not offer in Computer Science.

Most of my work is in the Wolfram Language with Mathematica.

I use Windows 10 Education for my operating system.


 I am working on writing good code. I would like to encourage developers to write good code.
 I hope to do this by using version control to store history with GitHub instead of just copying the file to a backup directory on my computer. I realize some of my commits to GitHub are pretty large and others are pretty small, but I think using GitHub is better than just doing file-1, file-2, file-3 and making a copy every time with a number attached or the date-time attached to the file name for version history. I am using GitHub and GitHub Desktop.
 I am using Mathematica 13.3 Prerelease version currently.
I have published content to the Wolfram paclet repository at paclets.com and the Wolfram Function Repository and the Wolfram Data Repository and the Wolfram Data Repository and Wikimedia Commons.

 I found this debugging blog post article at freecodecamp.org helpful: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-debugging-how-to-debug-code

 I am using JetBrains Fleet to edit the readme.md file.
 I am using Git with Visual Studio Code. For more details, see my blog post at https://peterburbery.com/2023/06/09/my-setup-for-visual-studio-code-aka-vs-code/
 I am working on using GitHub Copilot.
 I am also using a Wolfram Language extension for Visual Studio Code.
 I am using Ctrl+G Ctrl+Y for Git Sync instead of Ctrl+G Ctrl+S because s is more common than y and is more likely to run into keyboard shortcut conflicts. It's good to start with a rare keyboard shortcut to avoid conflicts.
 The frequencies are <|"z" -> 0.000739431, "q" -> 0.000959261, "x" -> 0.00149885, 
 "j" -> 0.00152882, "k" -> 0.00771406, "v" -> 0.00977248, 
 "b" -> 0.0149185, "p" -> 0.0192752, "y" -> 0.0197248, 
 "g" -> 0.0201345, "f" -> 0.0222629, "w" -> 0.0235818, 
 "m" -> 0.0258501, "u" -> 0.0275588, "c" -> 0.0277886, 
 "l" -> 0.0409085, "d" -> 0.0424973, "r" -> 0.0598239, 
 "h" -> 0.0608931, "s" -> 0.062292, "n" -> 0.0674381, 
 "i" -> 0.0696064, "o" -> 0.0750122, "a" -> 0.0808078, 
 "t" -> 0.0904903, "e" -> 0.126922|>.
 This data is from Sort[LetterFrequencyData[]] where LetterFrequencyData[] is from the Wolfram Function Repository.
 I am also using Ctrl+G Ctrl+M for Commit instead of Ctrl+G Ctrl+C for commit. I can use Ctrl+G Ctrl+R for merge if need be later. I changed the keyboard shortcut for Git Accept Message to Ctrl+G Ctrl+T because accept has a t and a is more common than t and t is rarer than a. I could use Ctrl+G Ctrl+K to track later on if need be.

I have experience with Alma Linux, Cent OS linux, Rocky Linux, Linux Mint, Fedora Linux, Kali linux, Pop linux, Ubuntu Linux, Manjaro Linux.

I am looking forward to ITER achieving Q=10 in 2035 in France. I believe sustained thermonuclear fusion controlled in a tokamak is the best way to ensure a good future of clean energy for future generations.

I like JetBrains IDEs. I have access to JetBrains products for free as a student. I have used IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm, Fleet, WebStorm, Datagrip, Space, MPS, Android Studio, and Php Storm. I use GitHub to sync work for my classes at Marshall University between computers and for work I do with Wolfram Mathematica which I also use a lot. I like using Chocolately to install packages on Windows.

I also enjoy using BricsCAD Ultimate by Bricscys which I have access to for free as a student. I am also excited about GitHub copilot which I have access to for free as a student. I am excited about AI. I am excited about ChatGPT and other applications of AI including Muzero and AlphaFold.

I love New York City.

I have also learned at Zero to Mastery Academy and freecodecamp.org. I also enjoy reading the art of computer programming by Donald Knuth.

I'm currently learning about combinatorics, factorials, binomials, subfactorials, Catalan numbers, multinomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, permutations, combinations, and derangements. 

I enjoy learning about American Civil War history and the great general Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. I also enjoy the writings of C. S. Lewis, St. Augustine, George MacDonald, and G. K. Chesterton.

I enjoy learning physics with materials by Richard Feynman with the Feymann lectures, Stephen Wolfram, and Douglas C. Giancoli.

I like Wikipedia, which I edit a lot. I also like freecodecamp.org founded by Quincy Larson. I also like lichess.org where I sometimes play chess.

I like Star Wars the first six movies. I don't think the new movies are canonical.

I have completed freecodecamp.org's responsive web design curriculum at https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/petercullenburbery/responsive-web-design.

I have a website at peterburbery.com. I have a page that serves as a repository for information about the SI at https://peterburbery.com/the-international-system-of-units-si/

**PeterCullenBurbery/PeterCullenBurbery** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dimensional analysis with Mathematica.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing the app GPSTest.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mixed chinese postman problem
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about arc routing and graph theory and chinese postman problem
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: petercullenburbery@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he him his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think Mathematica is the best programming language.
